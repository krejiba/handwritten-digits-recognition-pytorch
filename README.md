# Recognition of handwritten digits | Pytorch

This is a personal project using Python. In this project, we implement the LeNet5 model using Pytorch. We use the MNIST database which consists of 28-by-28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.

### How to use :
You need to download all the files in your working directory. The `lenet.py` file contains the LeNet5 class that we created for this project. The `main.py` file is where we do the training of the CNN.
You can use any Python IDE to run the `main.py` file and train the model. I used PyCharm Community Edition.
You can also run the code from the command line by typing `python main.py`.
